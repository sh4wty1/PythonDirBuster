# PythonDirBuster
Is like DirBuster, the Kali Linux tool, but for Windows and made in Python.
From 'https://www.kali.org/tools/dirbuster/':
DirBuster is a multi threaded java application designed to brute force directories and files names on web/application servers. Often is the case now of what looks like a web server in a state of default installation is actually not, and has pages and applications hidden within. DirBuster attempts to find these.
It's simple to use, just pay attention to the 'https://' part and put a '/' at the end, for example:
google.com is INCORRECT
https://google.com/ is CORRECT
Good use :)
